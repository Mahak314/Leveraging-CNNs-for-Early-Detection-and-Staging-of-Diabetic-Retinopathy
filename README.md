# Leveraging-CNNs-for-Early-Detection-and-Staging-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy
This project presents an automated system for detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Diabetic Retinopathy is a significant cause of blindness; early detection is essential for preventing severe outcomes.
